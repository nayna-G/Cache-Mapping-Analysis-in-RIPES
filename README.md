# Cache Mapping Analysis using RIPES RISC-V Simulator

This project demonstrates how cache associativity affects conflict misses using the Ripes RISC-V simulator. 

A pathological memory access pattern is used to create thrashing in a direct-mapped cache. The same program is then executed with a 4-way set-associative cache to show how increased associativity eliminates conflict misses without changing cache size or code.
